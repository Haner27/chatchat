Architecture of isolation zone, namely, the IZ.

I'll briefly introduce the mechainism for setting up the IZ for the sake of data privacy.
I won't go into detail, instead I'll just summerize some key steps to build the IZ.
First of all, you create a VPC for an isolated network. After that, you create
a vpn and associate it with one of the subnets of the vpc just created. Now you can test the connectivity 
using aws vpn client.
Then, create other components include EC2, ECR, EKS, S3 and configure their networking setting to include them into the vpc just created.
Last but not the least, create the endpoints on vpc for those components for fully private cluster and then turn off public network access
by editing the routing table for each of the subnets.  Now you have fully acitved isolation zone for model training and inference.
The isolation zone will be built on both side, biomap and sanofi with mirrored structure using S3 for sharing and transferring data. And we use IAM 
to manage the access.


6 components: VPC,EC2,ECR,EKS,EFS,S3

1. VPC, virtual private cloud, is the subnet with which the other components will be using to communitcate
2. S3, shared object storage for biomap and sanofi to share and transfer data including sample, training outputs, logs and the tool-sdk binaries
3. ECR container registry serves as a docker image repository
4. EKS, the kubernetes service is for distributed trainning
5. EFS, the file system is for distributed storage for saving trainning input and output
6, EC2, the computing cloud will be used for inference job and an agent to submit trainning task to EKS

Biomap will setup another IZ with a mirrored architecture, for testing and trainning
